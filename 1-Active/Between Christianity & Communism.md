# Idea (Simple Observation)

I formerly believes communism, and now I'm sort of inclining towards Christianity because of some sacred experience happened during my personal identity crisis. Communism/existentialism is too tough on people in general. It literally asks you to handle everything on your own and take responsibility of your every choice. 

However, in situations like Bible study or Sunday's gathering, I found that I adapted to Christianity faster than my peers from other atheism communities or peers who not really read Karl Marx's [Das Kapital](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E8%B5%84%E6%9C%AC%E8%AE%BA). The pastor said I think like a real Christian, and understand the religious ideas in the Bible faster. Why did this happen?

This sort of makes me think that Christianity and communism may have something in common.
