# Research Experience

I have the expertise in database systems and understands the low-level details of them. I have a paper on VLDB 2024 (second-author), where I designed a new concurrency control protocol for database systems under deterministic constraints. 
I contributed to CS4400 by making creating and updating exams easier. In this semester, I'm on the autograder team, dedicated to develop exam coding questions and task automations. I also contributed to the course by debugging the project phase 3 materials multiple times. 

# Teaching Experience

In this semster, I'm a GTA for CS4400 introduction to databases course.

# Motivation

For CS4400, I want people know and use database systems better. CS4400 is the first course that a student will take on database systems. I research on database systems to improve their performance. When people find database useful, it makes my work meaningful. 

For CS6515, the course material is good and the homework is challenging. I would be glad if I can help converse them to students.
