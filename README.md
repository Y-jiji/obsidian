# Y-jiji's Obsidian Vault

Most of my learning notes goes into this vault. 

## Don't Try to Peek

There are some personal stuff that I don't want to publish, so they are encrypted. 

To prevent myself from forgetting the key, I used a easy-to-memorize password to encrypt the encryption key, and published the encrypted key. 

```sh
bash obsidian-crypt.sh decrypt
```
