# Overview

Obsidian is a very powerful note-taking software, and it pioneered several note-taking concepts, like Zettelkasten method, map of concepts, and backlinks. 

Obsidian is also well-known for its community plugins. There are many plugins that provides powerful automation over an obsidian vault, which is basically the folder containing all the notes. However, I believe that most plugins are useless for most people. 

In this vault, I'm trying to experiment on a more flexible and flat folder structure. In previous failures in various method, I learned a lesson that too much presumption about how I will learn things is harmful. Many things I learn is on the brink of mathematics, computer science and logic. Therefore, sometimes it is painful to pick which folder I should put a piece of note, and demotivating for me to take notes (even in class). Mixing things in a flat structure seems making much more sense in my case. 

# Tagging System

I use a Fraktur type + content system for tagging notes. 

It helps me manage the presentation, format and status of a note.

# Kanban is Useful

Kanban makes it easy to track the status quo of various categories of things. 
I like Kanban. 

# Spaced Repetition

I started to use spaced repetition to refresh my ideas. There is a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF9lJ1rvnFA&ab_channel=ObsidianCommunityTalks) about spaced repetition on Youtube. A very surprising thing is that people can forget their own ideas, and things that they fully understand. For example, I forgot the proof of strong duality for linear programming for several times. Another very important insight is that human brains consolidate knowledge into abstraction through the same process as forgetting. (AI cannot do that for now, at least not in continuous learning. )

# Typst is Useful

[[Export from Obsidian via Typst|Typst]] is a perfect compensation for markdown. We can use it for exporting notes for reports, slides and draw pictures that can be re-used in publications. 

# Dataview is Useless

At least for me, dataview is a useless plugin. People use dataview to query their metadata, and specially marked inline data. In my case, my notes are mostly in math, computer science and philosophy. There is no structured metadata at all, so I can only use dataview with tags. But we have tag panels already, so I don't do dataview. 

# Daily Notes are Useless

Daily notes are not useful for me. Some typical use cases are: 
- Track your sleep by recording it in daily notes, and automatically create weekly tables of your sleep schedule. -- You can just remember your sleep time for the past a few weeks ...
- Recording ideas and thoughts & Logging discoveries from the day -- Why do you do this? If you put something in daily notes, you will never look into it and covert it to atomic concepts ...
- Linking to websites to read later -- You have your browser history. 
- Setting reminders -- Kanban
- Making to-do lists -- Kanban
- Taking Journals -- I don't. I'm already writing all the time.
