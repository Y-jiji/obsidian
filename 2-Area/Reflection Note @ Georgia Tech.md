# Idea (Doing Math)

1. Small Constructions : It seems like I'm still bad at 'small constructions'. For example: in [[CS6515 - Problem Set 7#QR Code Detection|QR Code Detection]] , it takes 30 minutes to come up with the required construction is on the diagonal. On part of that is I cannot consolidate the pattern of QR code fast enough, so later it takes longer to identify what is different in triangle detection. It also reveals that small constructions are really my weakness. (2024-11-09)

2. Capture Ideas : In the [[Stream Analysis of ECC|streaming project]], the idea of classifying back-$n$ links occurs exactly when I present that to Qianru (previously I don't have that notion in mind). Later, Jingfan made a formal version out of my description. It would also be better if I can reproduce that process individually. (2024-11-09)

3. Sketch Scheme : It seems like my 'sketch algorithm' for mathematical ideas only captures the birds' eye view. But small techniques may also be useful. In fact, maybe 90% of the time in mathematics is spent on developing and expanding details. Maybe in this review round of [@Book:Real-Analysis-Stein] and [@Book:Algebra-Galois-Theory], I should also break down the proofs for small techniques. (2024-11-09)

4. Reading : Sometimes I found reading is hard task for me. It takes a fairly long period of time to read through a piece of text. It is possible that I'm not reading to slow, but instead reading too fast, and unable to capture important information at that speed. (2024-11-09)

5. Uncompleted Knowledge: Maybe most part of my knowledge at the level of 80% of its full details. Therefore, it might be hard to apply them to immediately for their original use. (2024-11-09)

# Idea (Presentation Skills)

1. My language is still not flexible enough to describing what I want to say. I though that writing helps, but it doesn't. Maybe the reason is writing is still slower then speaking. So think about how to articulate things with spoken words. (2024-11-17)
