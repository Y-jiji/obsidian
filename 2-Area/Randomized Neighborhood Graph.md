# Idea (RNG)

On $RR^1$ space, nearest neighbor problem can be solved in $O(log n)$ time, using: 
- Structure: sorted array
- Algorithm: binary search

On $RR^2$ space, nearest neighbor problem can be solved in $O(log n)$ time, using: 
- Structure: Voronoi diagram [@Wiki:Voronoi-Diagram]
- Algorithm:
