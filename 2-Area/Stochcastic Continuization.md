# Definition (Continuization)

For a discrete [[Stochastic Process|stochastic process]] $mono("p") : Omega -> NN -> AA$, the continuization of this process is a continuous stochastic process $mono("q") : Omega -> RR^+ -> AA$ with a mapping $mono("s"): Omega -> NN -> RR^+$ , such that ${w:Omega} :: {i: NN} :: mono("q")(w, mono("s")(w)(i))$ and $mono("p")$ have the same [[Probability Distribution|distribution]] .
