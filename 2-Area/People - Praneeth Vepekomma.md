# Meet

Praneeth visited Georgia Tech in when I'm doing my Master's (2024) . 

Together with my mentor, we discussed to make privatized release of vector database using rotation techniques. 

When I mentioned my softmax attention compression idea, he told me to look into Eikonal equations to sample important key-value pairs.
