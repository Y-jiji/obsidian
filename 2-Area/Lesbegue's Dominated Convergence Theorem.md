There is mention here https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~shao/stat609/stat609-07.pdf , when I'm trying to recall [[Fisher Information#Cramér–Rao Bound]] . 

I'm pretty sure I saw this in Baby Rudin for the first time in elementary analysis and saw this in Stein's third book again under the measure theory framework.
