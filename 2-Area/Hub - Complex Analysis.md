# Overview

The [[Field of Complex Numbers|field of complex numbers]] is a magical concept [@Book:Complex-Analysis-Stein]. 

When a function is differentiable at a point in complex sense, a directional derivative implies properties of derivatives in other directions. 

Moreover, if a function $f: CC -> CC$ is differentiable everywhere on $CC$ (people use the term holomorphic in this case), then $f$ can be identified by its local behavior on any open set $Omega$ .
